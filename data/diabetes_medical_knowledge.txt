# Diabetes Medical Knowledge

## Types of Diabetes

**Type 1 Diabetes (T1D):**
Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreas. Absolute insulin deficiency requiring lifelong insulin therapy. 5-10% of all cases. Typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. Associated with other autoimmune conditions (Hashimoto's, Celiac). No known prevention.

**Type 2 Diabetes (T2D):**
Insulin resistance plus progressive beta cell dysfunction. 90-95% of cases. Strongly linked to obesity, sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, genetics. Usually adults over 45; rising in younger people. Can be prevented or delayed with lifestyle changes.

**Gestational Diabetes (GDM):**
Develops in second or third trimester; placental hormones cause insulin resistance. Usually resolves after delivery; increases future T2D risk. Associated with fetal macrosomia, birth complications. Affects 2-10% of pregnancies.

**Prediabetes:**
Elevated glucose below diabetes cutoffs (HbA1C 5.7-6.4%, FPG 100-125 mg/dL). Reversible with lifestyle intervention.

## Symptoms and Diagnosis

**Classic triad:** Polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (thirst), polyphagia (hunger). Also: unexplained weight loss (more in T1D), fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing wounds, frequent infections, peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning), acanthosis nigricans. Many T2D cases found on routine testing; average 4-7 year delay from onset to diagnosis.

**Diagnostic criteria:**
- **FPG:** Normal <100; Prediabetes 100-125; Diabetes ≥126 mg/dL (two tests)
- **HbA1C:** Normal <5.7%; Prediabetes 5.7-6.4%; Diabetes ≥6.5% (reflects 2-3 month average)
- **OGTT:** 75g load; diabetes if 2-hour ≥200 mg/dL; prediabetes 140-199
- **Random glucose:** ≥200 mg/dL with classic symptoms

**Additional tests:** C-peptide (insulin production); autoantibodies (GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8) for T1D vs T2D; lipids; kidney function (creatinine, eGFR); urine albumin-creatinine ratio.

## Treatments

**Insulin (T1D and advanced T2D):**
Rapid-acting (Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine); short-acting (Regular); intermediate (NPH); long-acting (Glargine, Detemir, Degludec). Dosing by meal and correction factors; pumps and CGM for intensive management.

**Oral and injectable agents:**
- **Metformin:** First-line T2D. Reduces hepatic glucose, improves sensitivity. Weight-neutral, low hypoglycemia risk. Avoid if eGFR <30.
- **Sulfonylureas:** Glipizide, Glyburide, Glimepiride. Stimulate insulin release. Risk: hypoglycemia, weight gain.
- **DPP-4 inhibitors:** Sitagliptin, Linagliptin. Incretin-based; weight-neutral.
- **SGLT2 inhibitors:** Empagliflozin, Dapagliflozin, Canagliflozin. Promote glycosuria; CV and kidney benefits; watch for DKA, UTIs.
- **GLP-1 agonists:** Semaglutide, Liraglutide, Dulaglutide. Injectable (some oral). Weight loss, CV protection. Contraindicated with medullary thyroid cancer history.
- **Thiazolidinediones:** Pioglitazone. Improves sensitivity; weight gain, fluid retention, fracture risk.

## Acute Complications

**Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):** T1D emergency. Severe insulin lack → lipolysis, ketones, metabolic acidosis. Presentation: glucose >250, pH <7.3, bicarbonate <18, ketones positive. Kussmaul breathing, fruity breath, altered mental status. Treat: IV saline, IV insulin, potassium/phosphate, find precipitant (infection, missed insulin). Mortality 1-5%.

**Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS):** T2D. Extreme hyperglycemia (>600 mg/dL), osmolality >320, no significant ketosis, severe dehydration. Treat: aggressive fluids, then insulin. Mortality 10-20%.

**Hypoglycemia:** <70 mg/dL. From insulin or sulfonylureas. Autonomic symptoms (tremor, sweat, palpitations) then neuroglycopenic (confusion, seizure, coma). Treat: 15-20g fast-acting carbs; severe: glucagon 1 mg IM or IV dextrose.

## Chronic Complications

**Macrovascular:** 2-4× risk of CAD, MI, stroke, PAD. Prevention: BP <130/80, statins, antiplatelet, smoking cessation.

**Diabetic retinopathy:** Leading cause of working-age blindness. Stages: non-proliferative → proliferative → macular edema. Annual dilated exam; laser, anti-VEGF. Each 1% HbA1C drop cuts risk ~35%.

**Diabetic nephropathy:** Leading cause of ESRD. Progression: hyperfiltration → microalbuminuria → macroalbuminuria → declining GFR → dialysis/transplant. ACEi or ARB, BP and glucose control, protein restriction when advanced.

**Diabetic neuropathy:** Up to 50% of patients. Peripheral: distal symmetric polyneuropathy, foot ulcers, loss of protective sensation. Autonomic: gastroparesis, resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, bladder/erectile dysfunction. Pain: gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine. Foot care and podiatry essential.

**Diabetic foot:** Neuropathy + PAD + infection risk → ulcers (15% lifetime), osteomyelitis, gangrene. Diabetes causes majority of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations. Daily inspection, proper footwear, multidisciplinary foot care.

## Goals and Lifestyle

**Glycemic targets:** HbA1C <7% for most (individualize by age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk). Preprandial 80-130 mg/dL; postprandial <180. BP <130/80. LDL <100 (<70 if ASCVD). Triglycerides <150; HDL >40 men, >50 women.

**Lifestyle:** Medical nutrition therapy (carb counting, portion control, Mediterranean/DASH). ≥150 min/week moderate aerobic plus resistance 2-3×/week. 5-10% weight loss improves glycemic control in overweight T2D. Self-monitoring or CGM for insulin users.

**Preventive care:** Annual dilated eye exam; annual urine albumin and eGFR; annual foot exam; flu, pneumococcal, hepatitis B (adults 19-59) vaccines.
