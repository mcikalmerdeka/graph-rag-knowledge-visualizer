# Diabetes Medical Knowledge

## Types of Diabetes

**Type 1 Diabetes (T1D):**
Autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreas. Absolute insulin deficiency requiring lifelong insulin therapy. Represents 5-10% of all diabetes cases. Typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, though adult-onset occurs. Associated with other autoimmune conditions (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Celiac disease). No known prevention.

**Type 2 Diabetes (T2D):**
Insulin resistance combined with progressive beta cell dysfunction. Represents 90-95% of cases. Strongly associated with obesity, sedentary lifestyle, metabolic syndrome, and genetic factors. Usually diagnosed in adults over 45, but increasing in younger populations. Can be prevented or delayed with lifestyle modifications.

**Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM):**
Develops during second or third trimester of pregnancy. Caused by placental hormones inducing insulin resistance. Usually resolves after delivery but increases future T2D risk by 7-fold. Associated with fetal macrosomia and birth complications. Affects 2-10% of pregnancies.

**Prediabetes:**
Elevated blood glucose not meeting diabetes thresholds. HbA1C 5.7-6.4% or FPG 100-125 mg/dL. 70% of prediabetics will develop T2D without intervention. Reversible with lifestyle changes.

## Symptoms and Clinical Presentation

**Classic Triad:**
- **Polyuria:** Excessive urination due to osmotic diuresis from glucosuria
- **Polydipsia:** Excessive thirst from dehydration caused by polyuria  
- **Polyphagia:** Excessive hunger from cellular inability to utilize glucose

**Additional Symptoms:**
- Unexplained weight loss (more common in T1D)
- Fatigue and weakness from energy deficiency
- Blurred vision from osmotic lens changes
- Slow-healing wounds and frequent infections (impaired immunity)
- Peripheral neuropathy: numbness, tingling, burning pain in extremities
- Acanthosis nigricans: darkened skin patches in insulin-resistant patients
- Recurrent yeast infections (candidiasis)

**Asymptomatic Presentation:**
Many T2D patients diagnosed incidentally during routine testing. Average delay between onset and diagnosis is 4-7 years.

## Diagnostic Criteria

**Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):**
- Normal: <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)
- Prediabetes: 100-125 mg/dL (5.6-6.9 mmol/L)
- Diabetes: ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) on two separate occasions

**HbA1C (Glycated Hemoglobin):**
- Normal: <5.7%
- Prediabetes: 5.7-6.4%
- Diabetes: ≥6.5%
- Reflects average glucose over 2-3 months

**Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):**
- 75g glucose load after overnight fast
- Diabetes: ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) at 2 hours
- Prediabetes: 140-199 mg/dL (7.8-11.0 mmol/L)

**Random Plasma Glucose:**
≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) with classic symptoms

**Additional Testing:**
- C-peptide: Assesses endogenous insulin production
- Autoantibodies (GAD65, IA-2, ZnT8): Distinguishes T1D from T2D
- Lipid profile: Cardiovascular risk assessment
- Kidney function: Serum creatinine, eGFR
- Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio: Early nephropathy detection

## Pharmacological Treatments

**Insulin Therapy (Required for T1D, advanced T2D):**
- **Rapid-acting:** Lispro (Humalog), Aspart (Novolog), Glulisine (Apidra) - onset 10-15 min, peak 1-2 hours
- **Short-acting:** Regular insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R) - onset 30 min, peak 2-4 hours
- **Intermediate-acting:** NPH insulin - onset 1-2 hours, peak 4-8 hours

- Side effects: Nasopharyngitis, rare pancreatitis

**SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Empagliflozin (Jardiance), Dapagliflozin (Farxiga), Canagliflozin (Invokana)
- Block glucose reabsorption in kidneys (promote glycosuria)
- Benefits: Cardiovascular protection, weight loss, blood pressure reduction
- Risks: Genitourinary infections, diabetic ketoacidosis (rare), volume depletion
- Contraindications: Recurrent UTIs, severe renal impairment

**GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:** Semaglutide (Ozempic), Liraglutide (Victoza), Dulaglutide (Trulicity)
- Injectable medications (some oral formulations)
- Enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppress glucagon, slow gastric emptying
- Benefits: Significant weight loss (10-15%), cardiovascular protection
- Contraindications: Personal/family history medullary thyroid carcinoma, MEN2

**Thiazolidinediones:** Pioglitazone (Actos), Rosiglitazone (Avandia)
- Improve insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues
- Side effects: Weight gain, fluid retention, increased fracture risk
- Contraindications: Heart failure, bladder cancer history

## Acute Complications

**Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):**
Life-threatening emergency primarily in T1D. Severe insulin deficiency causes lipolysis and ketone production (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetone), leading to metabolic acidosis.
- Presentation: Blood glucose >250 mg/dL, pH <7.3, bicarbonate <18 mEq/L, positive ketones
- Symptoms: Kussmaul breathing (deep rapid respirations), fruity breath, altered mental status, abdominal pain, vomiting
- Treatment: IV fluids (normal saline), IV insulin, electrolyte replacement (potassium, phosphate), treat precipitating cause (infection, missed insulin)
- Mortality: 1-5% with treatment

**Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS):**
Severe complication primarily in T2D. Extreme hyperglycemia without significant ketosis causes profound osmotic diuresis and dehydration.
- Presentation: Blood glucose >600 mg/dL, serum osmolality >320 mOsm/kg, severe dehydration (8-10L deficit)
- Symptoms: Altered mental status or coma, absence of ketoacidosis
- Treatment: Aggressive fluid resuscitation (more gradual than DKA), insulin after initial rehydration
- Mortality: 10-20%

**Hypoglycemia:**
Blood glucose <70 mg/dL. Caused by insulin or sulfonylureas. Symptoms progress from autonomic (tremor, sweating, palpitations) to neuroglycopenic (confusion, seizures, coma).
- Treatment: 15-20g fast-acting carbohydrates (glucose tablets, juice) for conscious patients
- Severe: Glucagon injection (1mg IM) or IV dextrose for unconscious patients

## Chronic Complications

**Macrovascular Complications:**
- **Cardiovascular Disease:** 2-4 fold increased risk. Coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease
- **Prevention:** Aggressive blood pressure control (<130/80), statin therapy, antiplatelet agents, smoking cessation

**Microvascular Complications:**

**Diabetic Retinopathy:** Leading cause of blindness in working-age adults
- **Stages:** Non-proliferative (microaneurysms, hemorrhages, hard exudates) → Proliferative (neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage) → Diabetic macular edema
- **Management:** Annual dilated eye exams, optimal glycemic control (every 1% HbA1C reduction decreases risk 35%), laser photocoagulation, anti-VEGF injections

**Diabetic Nephropathy:** Leading cause of end-stage renal disease
- **Stages:** Hyperfiltration → Microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/day) → Macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/day) → Declining GFR → ESRD requiring dialysis/transplantation
- **Management:** ACE inhibitors or ARBs for renoprotection, blood pressure control, glycemic control, protein restriction in advanced disease

**Diabetic Neuropathy:** Affects up to 50% of patients
- **Peripheral Neuropathy:** Distal symmetric polyneuropathy causing numbness, tingling, burning pain. Loss of protective sensation increases foot ulcer risk.
- **Autonomic Neuropathy:** Gastroparesis (delayed gastric emptying), cardiac autonomic neuropathy (resting tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension), bladder dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, gustatory sweating
- **Management:** Optimal glycemic control, foot care education, neuropathic pain medications (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine)

**Diabetic Foot Disease:**
Combination of neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease, and impaired immunity leads to:
- Foot ulcers (15% lifetime risk), infections (cellulitis, osteomyelitis), gangrene
- Diabetes accounts for 60% of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations
- **Prevention:** Daily foot inspection, proper footwear, regular podiatric care, multidisciplinary foot care teams

## Management Goals and Interventions

**Glycemic Targets:**
- HbA1C: <7% for most adults (individualize based on age, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk)
- Preprandial glucose: 80-130 mg/dL
- Postprandial glucose: <180 mg/dL

**Cardiovascular Risk Reduction:**
- Blood pressure: <130/80 mmHg
- LDL cholesterol: <100 mg/dL (<70 mg/dL if ASCVD present)
- Triglycerides: <150 mg/dL
- HDL cholesterol: >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women)
- Aspirin therapy for secondary prevention

**Lifestyle Interventions:**
