# Mergers and Acquisitions Legal Framework

## Overview

Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) are complex corporate transactions involving consolidation of companies or assets through various legal and financial mechanisms. These transactions require extensive due diligence, regulatory approvals, and careful structuring to allocate risks between buyers and sellers.

## Transaction Types

**Merger:**
Two companies combine to form a single entity. The acquiring company absorbs the target, which ceases to exist as a separate legal entity. Shareholders of both companies typically receive shares in the combined entity. Types include:
- **Statutory Merger:** Direct merger governed by state law
- **Triangular Merger:** Subsidiary merges with target to isolate liabilities
- **Reverse Triangular Merger:** Target subsidiary survives, maintains contracts

**Acquisition:**
Acquirer purchases controlling interest in target company. Target may continue as subsidiary or be fully absorbed. Control typically means >50% voting rights, though effective control can occur at lower thresholds.

**Asset Purchase:**
Acquirer buys specific assets and selected liabilities. Allows cherry-picking desired assets while avoiding unwanted obligations. Commonly used for distressed assets or to avoid successor liability.

**Stock Purchase:**
Acquirer buys target's outstanding shares directly from shareholders. Acquires all assets and liabilities, known and unknown. Simpler than asset purchase but carries more risk.

**Tender Offer:**
Public offer to purchase shares directly from shareholders at premium to market price. May be:
- **Friendly:** Approved by target board
- **Hostile:** Opposed by target management, requires shareholder acceptance
