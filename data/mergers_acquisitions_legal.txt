# Mergers and Acquisitions Legal Framework

## Overview

M&A are corporate transactions that consolidate companies or assets through mergers, acquisitions, asset or stock purchases. They require due diligence, regulatory approvals, and careful structuring to allocate risk between buyer and seller.

## Transaction Types

**Merger:** Two companies combine into one. The acquiring company absorbs the target, which ceases to exist. Types: statutory merger (state law); triangular (subsidiary merges with target to isolate liabilities); reverse triangular (target subsidiary survives, keeps contracts).

**Acquisition:** Acquirer buys controlling interest in target. Control usually means >50% voting rights. Target may remain a subsidiary or be fully absorbed.

**Asset Purchase:** Buyer selects specific assets and chosen liabilities. Cherry-picks what it wants and avoids unwanted obligations. Used for distressed assets or to limit successor liability.

**Stock Purchase:** Buyer acquires target’s shares from shareholders. Gets all assets and liabilities, known and unknown. Simpler than asset deal but riskier.

**Tender Offer:** Public offer to buy shares from shareholders at a premium. Friendly (board-approved) or hostile (opposed by management, depends on shareholder acceptance).

## Transaction Documents

**Letter of Intent (LOI) / MOU:** Non-binding. Outlines purchase price or valuation method, due diligence scope (often 30-90 days), exclusivity (no-shop), confidentiality, key conditions, expense split. Binding elements: confidentiality, exclusivity, expense reimbursement, standstill.

**Definitive Purchase Agreement:**

**Purchase price:** Base price, working capital adjustments, cash-free debt-free mechanics, earnouts, escrow (often 10-20% for indemnification).

**Representations and warranties:** Facts about the target—financial statements, undisclosed liabilities, material contracts, employees, IP, real property, litigation, regulatory compliance.

**Covenants:** Pre-closing (run business in ordinary course, make filings, provide access); post-closing (non-compete, non-solicit, transition services).

**Conditions precedent:** Regulatory clearances (HSR, CFIUS, foreign investment), shareholder approval, key third-party consents, no material adverse effect, reps true at closing.

**Indemnification:** Caps (often 10-30% of purchase price), baskets (0.5-1.5% threshold before claims apply), survival (12-24 months for general reps; longer or indefinite for fundamental). Allocates risk for breaches and undisclosed liabilities.

**Termination:** Mutual consent; failure to get regulatory or other approvals; failure to close by outside date (often 6-12 months); material breach; in some cases superior proposal. Reverse breakup fee (acquirer pays if it breaches): often 3-5%. Target breakup fee (if target accepts superior offer): often 2-4%.

**Ancillary agreements:** Disclosure schedules (exceptions to reps); employment/retention for key people; Transition Services Agreement (TSA) for post-closing support (6-18 months); non-compete (2-5 years, reasonable scope); escrow agreement.

## Regulatory (US)

**SEC:** Form S-4 (securities issued as consideration); Form 8-K (material events, within 4 business days); Schedule 13D (>5% of voting securities, 10 days); Schedule 14A (proxy for shareholder vote).

**Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR):** Pre-merger notification when size-of-transaction exceeds threshold (e.g. >$119.5M in 2026) and size-of-person tests are met. 30-day waiting period; filing fees from $45K to $2.25M; agency may issue Second Request for more information.

**CFIUS:** Reviews foreign investment in the US that may affect national security. Mandatory filings for certain critical infrastructure, sensitive data, and critical technology. 45-day initial review, up to 45-day investigation. Can require mitigation or recommend presidential block.

**International:** EU (EUMR—turnover thresholds; Phase I 25 working days, Phase II up to 90-105). UK (CMA—e.g. £70M turnover or 25% share of supply). China (SAMR under Anti-Monopoly Law—revenue thresholds).

## Due Diligence

**Financial:** Historical financials (3-5 years), quality of earnings, working capital and normalization, debt and liabilities, related party transactions, projections and assumptions.

**Legal:** Corporate structure and governance; material contracts (customers, suppliers, licenses); IP and infringement risk; litigation and regulatory matters; real property and leases; environmental; employment and labor.

**Tax:** Federal, state, local compliance; tax structure and planning; NOLs (Section 382 limits); transfer pricing; tax sharing agreements.

**Operational:** Commercial (market, customer concentration, competition); technology and IT (infrastructure, licensing, cybersecurity); regulatory (industry licenses, permits); insurance (coverage, claims).

## Valuation and Financing

**Valuation methods:** Comparable public companies (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E); precedent M&A transactions (control premium often 20-40%); DCF (projected cash flows, terminal value, WACC); LBO (price a financial buyer could pay for target IRR, e.g. 20-25%).

**Debt:** Senior secured term loans (e.g. SOFR + 3-5%, 5-7 years, amortization); revolvers (working capital); high yield (6-10%, 7-10 years, bullet); mezzanine (10-14%, often PIK, warrants). **Equity:** Common or preferred; earnouts.

## Key Risks and Protections

**Material Adverse Effect (MAE):** Clause letting buyer exit if target suffers major negative change. Carveouts typically include general economy, industry trends, law changes, war/terrorism, disasters, and disclosed risks.

**Fraudulent transfer:** In leveraged deals, target may be left insolvent. Protections: solvency certificates, fairness opinions, adequate capitalization.

**Successor liability:** Even in asset deals, buyer can inherit product liability, environmental, or employment claims. Mitigations: broad indemnification, RWI, liability carveouts.

**Representations and Warranties Insurance (RWI):** Third-party policy for breach of reps. Typical coverage 10-30% of deal value; premium 3-6% of coverage; retention 0.5-1% of value. Often excludes known issues and forward-looking statements.

## Post-Merger Integration

Many deals fail to achieve expected value. Success factors: Day One readiness (IT, payroll, customer service); dedicated integration team (IMO); 100-day plan. Integrate finance, HR, sales, operations, technology. Define and track revenue and cost synergies.
