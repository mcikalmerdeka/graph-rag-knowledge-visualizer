## Critical Materials and Components

**Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) Materials:**
- **Lithium:** Battery cathodes from Australia (spodumene), Chile/Argentina (brine), China (processing)
- **Cobalt:** Democratic Republic of Congo (70% global supply) for cathode stability
- **Nickel:** Indonesia, Philippines, Russia for high-energy NMC/NCA cathodes
- **Graphite:** Anodes from China (synthetic), Mozambique, Tanzania (natural)
- **Rare Earth Elements:** Neodymium, praseodymium for motor magnets - China dominates 85% processing

**Semiconductors:**
- Modern vehicles contain 1,000-3,000 chips
- Control systems: Powertrain, ADAS, infotainment, HVAC, lighting
- Major suppliers: Nvidia (AI), Qualcomm (infotainment), Mobileye (ADAS)
- Manufacturing: TSMC (Taiwan), Samsung (South Korea), Intel (USA)

**Traditional Materials:**
- **Steel:** 50-60% of vehicle weight, high-strength grades for safety
- **Aluminum:** 30% lighter than steel, used for hoods, doors, wheels
- **Plastics:** Bumpers, interior panels, under-hood components
- **Rubber:** Tires, seals, hoses

## Supply Chain Risks

**Geographic Concentration Risks:**
- **China:** 85% rare earth processing, 60% lithium processing, 75% battery cell production, 40% semiconductor assembly
- **Taiwan:** TSMC produces 60% global semiconductors, 90% advanced chips
- **Democratic Republic of Congo:** 70% global cobalt supply
- **Ukraine:** Pre-war supplier of wiring harnesses and neon gas for chip manufacturing

**Operational Models:**
- **Just-In-Time (JIT):** Toyota pioneered system with 2-4 hour delivery windows
- **Just-In-Sequence (JIS):** Components delivered in exact assembly order (seats, dashboards)
- **Build-to-Order:** Custom configurations, 4-12 week lead times
- **Build-to-Stock:** Forecast-driven production, immediate dealer availability

**Vulnerability Factors:**
- Single-source dependencies for specialized components
- Long supplier qualification periods (12-24 months)
- Limited inventory buffers due to JIT principles
- Geopolitical tensions affecting trade flows
- Natural disasters (2011 Japan earthquake disrupted global supply)

## Quality Management Systems

**IATF 16949 Standard:**
- International automotive quality management system
- Based on ISO 9001 with industry-specific requirements
- Mandatory for all automotive suppliers
- Covers: Process control, risk management, continuous improvement

**Core Quality Tools:**
- **APQP (Advanced Product Quality Planning):** 5-phase development process
- **PPAP (Production Part Approval Process):** 18-element submission for approval
- **FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis):** Risk assessment methodology
- **SPC (Statistical Process Control):** Real-time quality monitoring
- **MSA (Measurement System Analysis):** Gage calibration and capability

**Supplier Scorecard Metrics:**
- Quality: Parts per million (PPM) defect rate
- Delivery: On-time delivery percentage
- Cost: Price competitiveness and productivity
- Responsiveness: Issue resolution speed
- Innovation: Technology advancement proposals

## Key Industry Challenges

**Supply Chain Disruptions:**
- 2021-2023 semiconductor shortage reduced global vehicle production by millions
- COVID-19 pandemic exposed fragility of JIT systems
- Russia-Ukraine war disrupted wiring harness and neon gas supplies
- Increasing frequency of climate-related disruptions

**Regulatory Pressures:**
- **Environmental:** EU CBAM (carbon border adjustments), Extended Producer Responsibility
- **Safety:** IATF 16949 compliance, product liability regulations
- **Trade:** USMCA (North America), Brexit (UK-EU), US-China tariffs
- **Conflict Minerals:** Dodd-Frank Act due diligence requirements

**Technology Transition:**
- Shift from internal combustion to electric vehicles requires new supplier base
- Software-defined vehicles need electronics and software suppliers
- Autonomous driving requires AI chips, sensors, LiDAR
- Traditional powertrain suppliers face obsolescence risk

**Cybersecurity:**
- Connected vehicles vulnerable to cyber attacks
- Ransomware attacks on suppliers halt production
- Over-the-air updates require secure infrastructure
- Supply chain attacks (SolarWinds-style) pose threats
